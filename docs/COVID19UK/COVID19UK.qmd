# Backgrounds

# Methods

## Study design and participants

-   UKHLS : The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS; Understanding Society) is an ongoing panel survey of more than 40000 households that began in 2009.

-   From April 23 to April 30, 2020, members of households who participated in either of the two most recent UKHLS data collections (Waves 8 or 9), who were older than age 16 years, were invited to complete the first wave of the COVID-19 web survey.

-   Both the UKHLS main survey waves and the COVID-19 web survey included the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), which was used as the primary outcome measure.

-   **Repeated cross-sectional analysis:**\
    UKHLS Waves 6–9 participants with available GHQ-12 data were included to examine overall temporal trends.

-   **Fixed-effects analysis:**\
    Participants from Waves 8 or 9 who completed the COVID-19 survey and had prior GHQ-12 measures were included to evaluate within-person changes.

## Outcomes

### GHQ-12 Scoring

-   Mean score reflects average symptom burden; threshold reflects clinical distress prevalence.

-   Fixed-effects analyses used the mean GHQ-12 score (continuous outcome).

Mean symptoms score(0-36)

-   0 = not at all

-   1 = no more than usual

-   2 = rather more than usual

-   3 = much more than usual

Item scores summed across 12 questions

**Binary threshold score (0–12):**

Responses scored as:

-   0 = not at all / no more than usual

-   1 = rather more than usual / much more than usual

Scores summed across items

Clinically significant distress defined as ≥4

## Statistical analysis

### Repeated cross-sectional data

-   Descriptive summaries of GHQ-12 across survey waves

    -   **By survey wave (time)**

    -   **By key sociodemographic characteristics**, including:

        -   Sex

        -   Age group

        -   Ethnicity

        -   Household income

        -   Other predefined subgroups

-   Mean scores and threshold prevalence reported (Tables 1–3)

-   Used to describe population-level trends, not individual change

### Fixed-Effects Models

-   Analysis restricted to participants with **linked pre-pandemic and COVID-19 GHQ-12 data**

-   Fixed-effects linear regression :

    -   ​A regression approach that estimates effects using **within-person variation over time**

    -   Each individual serves as **their own control**

-   Model specification

    -   Included:

        -   Individual fixed effects

        -   Calendar time, modelled as:

            -   Linear term (time)

            -   Quadratic term (time²)

        -   COVID-19 period indicator

    -   COVID-19 coefficient interpreted as:

        -   The deviation from expected GHQ-12 scores based on pre-pandemic trends

-   Heterogeneity analysis

    -   Tested interactions between:

        -   COVID-19 indicator × predefined subgroups

    -   Subgroups tested individually

    -   Interactions with p \< 0.05 included in a final adjusted model

    -   Adjusted estimates interpreted as independent subgroup-specific changes, accounting for overlapping characteristics

# Outcome

## cross-sectional data

![](fig2.png)

![](fig3.png)

![](fig4.png)

-   Mean GHQ-12 and distress prevalence increased over time

-   Larger symptom burden observed among women, younger adults, ethnic minorities, and low-income groups

-   Apparent widening of inequalities during the COVID-19 period

## Fixed-effects analysis

![](fig5.png)

Overall, GHQ-12 scores during the COVID-19 period were **0.48 points higher** (95% CI 0.07–0.90) than would have been expected had pre-pandemic trends continued.

This indicates a population-wide deterioration in mental health beyond existing temporal trends.

$$
Y_{it}
=
\alpha_i
+
\beta_1 \,\text{COVID}_{it}
+
\beta_2 t
+
\beta_3 t^2
+
\varepsilon_{it},
$$

The estimated coefficient

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = 0.48
$$

represents the average deviation of observed GHQ-12 scores during the COVID-19 period from values expected based on pre-pandemic trends.

### Subgroup Heterogeneity

-   To assess heterogeneity in pandemic-associated change, interactions between the COVID-19 indicator and predefined subgroups were fitted.

-   Each subgroup was first examined separately by fitting a fixed-effects linear regression model that included a single interaction term between the COVID-19 indicator and the subgroup variable.

-   Only subgroups for which the interaction term was statistically significant (two-sided ( p \< 0.05 )) in these unadjusted models were retained for inclusion in the final multivariable model.

#### Women vs Men

Women experienced a substantially larger increase in GHQ-12 scores during the COVID-19 period compared with men.

$$
Y_{it}
=
\alpha_i
+
\beta_1 \text{COVID}_{it}
+
\gamma_1 (\text{COVID}_{it} \times \text{Female}_i)
+
\beta_2 t
+
\beta_3 t^2
+
\varepsilon_{it}.
$$

-   For men (reference group):

$$
\Delta_{\text{Men}} = \beta_1
$$

-   For women :

$$
\Delta_{\text{Women}} = \beta_1 + \gamma_1
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Age Groups

Younger adults showed larger within-person increases in GHQ-12 scores during the COVID-19 period compared with older age groups.

For a categorical age variable with reference group ( r ), the model can be written as:

$$
Y_{it}
=
\alpha_i
+
\beta_1 \text{COVID}_{it}
+
\sum_{k \neq r}
\gamma_k
(\text{COVID}_{it} \times \mathbb{1}\{\text{Age}_i = k\})
+
\beta_2 t
+
\beta_3 t^2
+
\varepsilon_{it}.
$$

-   COVID-related change for the reference age group:

$$
\Delta_r = \beta_1
$$

-   COVID-related change for age group ( k ):

$$
\Delta_k = \beta_1 + \gamma_k
$$

# Discussion

-   COVID-19 was associated with a population-wide deterioration in mental health beyond pre-existing trends.

-   Apparent inequalities in cross-sectional analyses largely reflect baseline differences rather than differential within-person change.

-   Fixed-effects analyses identify women and younger adults experiencing greater deterioration.

### limitations

-   Fixed-effects models cannot account for time-varying unmeasured confounders.

-   Analyses focused on the early phase of the pandemic and may not capture longer-term effects.
