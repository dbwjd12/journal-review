### Outcomes

-   ICD 10, F code
-   at least 2 diseases
-   severe : psychotic feature

:::

## Methods - covariates
::: {.panel-tabset}

## Methods
::: {.panel-tabset} 

### propensity score matching

-   matching method : greedy nearest-neighbor matching within specified caliper(0.001)

### greedy nearest neighbor matching

```{r}

library(data.table) 
data.table(treated = seq(0,10,0.7), untreated = seq(1,15,1))
```

### greedy nearest neighbor matching - order

```{r}

library(data.table)
data.table(treated = c(0.0, 1.4, 0.7, 2.1, 2.8, 3.5, 4.2, 4.9, 5.6, 6.3, 7.0, 7.7, 8.4, 9.1, 9.8), untreated = seq(1,15,1))
```



### propensity score matching

-   matching method : greedy nearest-neighbor matching within specified caliper(0.001)
-   random order
-   replacement
-   1:5

### Cohorts

![](journal-review/docs/BMJ/study population1.jpg)

### Statistical analysis

-   Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional hazards model
-   crude / adjusted / fully adjusted
-   maternal age at delivery years, infant's sex, region of residence, household income level, birth season, parity, maternal mental illness, severe maternal morbidity score, hospital outpatient visit, hospital admission contact
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
-   history of maternal neuropsychiatric conditions, use of NSAIDs, use of acetaminophen
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
-   child screening cohort : adjusted for breastfeeding history

## Strengths
- validated and large sample
- characterise numerous potential confounders
- various study designs

## Limitations
- Prescriptions may not always reflect the actual consumption of the medication
- even with our sibling controlled analyses, potential confounding by unobserved non-shared familial factors exists
- an association but not explain the causal association 
owing to the observational nature of our study
