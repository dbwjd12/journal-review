## Methods - propensity score matching

-   matching method : greedy nearest-neighbor matching within specified caliper(0.001)

## greedy nearest neighbor matching

```{r}

library(data.table) 
data.table(treated = seq(0,10,0.7), untreated = seq(1,15,1))
```

## greedy nearest neighbor matching - order

```{r}

library(data.table)
data.table(treated = c(0.0, 1.4, 0.7, 2.1, 2.8, 3.5, 4.2, 4.9, 5.6, 6.3, 7.0, 7.7, 8.4, 9.1, 9.8), untreated = seq(1,15,1))
```

## greedy nearest neighbor matching - replacement

```{r}
library(data.table) 
data.table(treated = c(0.0, 1.4, 0.7, 2.1, 2.8, 3.5, 4.2, 4.9, 5.6, 6.3, 7.0, 7.7, 8.4, 9.1, 9.8), untreated = seq(0,14,1))
```

## Methods - propensity score matching

-   matching method : greedy nearest-neighbor matching within specified caliper(0.001)
-   random order
-   replacement
-   1:5

## Methods - Cohorts

![](docs/BMJ/study population1.jpg)

## Methods - Statistical analysis

-   Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional hazards model
-   crude / adjusted / fully adjusted
-   maternal age at delivery years, infant's sex, region of residence, household income level, birth season, parity, maternal mental illness, severe maternal morbidity score, hospital outpatient visit, hospital admission contact\
-   history of maternal neuropsychiatric conditions, use of NSAIDs, use of acetaminophen
-   child screening cohort : adjusted for breastfeeding history
